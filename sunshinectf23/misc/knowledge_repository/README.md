## Solution
For this challenge we get a zip file containing a `electronic mail format (eml)` file. The file contains email subject and text encoded as base64. The subject says

```
AI Greets Thee Human with the Repository of Knowledge

Hello human.
I greet thee, and attached I have the repository of knowledge, as requested.
However, as this repository of knowledge contains great information, I have hidden the knowledge in a puzzle.
Feel free to unlock the puzzle, but if you do, beware.

There is no going back, once the knowledge is released.
I have encoded the knowledge in a bit of information from one of the math scholars of your people.
Feel free to poke at it.
Beware... you will only fine one flag raised in the knowledge repo, and I follow the standard.
Respectfully,
The AI
```

Interesting... The email content contains a base64 encoded `git bundle`. Lets create a repository to see what the bundle contains:

```bash
$ git bundle verify ../git_bundle
The bundle contains this ref:
e2483776f7011364f613a64e05201b66b1aa2997 HEAD
The bundle records a complete history.
../git_bundle is okay
$ git clone ../git_bundle
Cloning into 'git_bundle'...
Receiving objects: 100% (3082/3082), 397.15 KiB | 30.55 MiB/s, done.

Note: switching to 'e2483776f7011364f613a64e05201b66b1aa2997'.
$ cd git_bundle
$ ls
data
```

There is one file in the git repository and the `file` command tells us this is `RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 8 bit, mono 11050 Hz`. When we listen to this audio file we cleary can hear a morse signal. To decode [`online tools`](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) exist. The signal decodes to:

```
ECHOQUEBECUNIFORMALFALIMASIERRASIERRAINDIAGOLFNOVEMBER
```

If we look closely we can split this into single words `ECHO QUEBEC UNIFORM ALFA LIMA SIERRA SIERRA INDIA GOLF NOVEMBER`, all the words are from [`NATO phonetic alphabet`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) and are typically used for clearly pronounced word spelling. The starting characters of each word concatenated give us `EQUALSSIGN` which of course is a `=` sign. 

Since this is not the flag, there needs to be more, so we go back to the repository and check the commit history.

```bash
$ git rev-list --count --all
3016
```

The repository has `3016` commits and for every commit `data` was changed. To see whats going on I randomly chose commits and decoded the morse signal and got results รก la `ALFA`, `BRAVO`, `CHARLIE` etc.. In short, every commit contained a file describing *one* character from the `NATO phonetic alphabet`. Or at least this is the assumption. Moreover we can assume that concatenating the associated characters would give us some sort of text. Since we already found an outlier (`EQUALSSIGN`) this hints that the text is encoded as [`base64`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) or [`base32`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32). If we look at the `NATO phonetic alphabet` we find that it contains characters `A-Z` and numbers `0-9`, base64 differs between upper and lowercase but base32 matches very closely, except only numbers `1-7` are used. So maybe we the resulting text is base32 encoded.

Right, to encode the text we first need every revision of `data`. This can be scripted quickly. I [`found`](https://gist.github.com/magnetikonline/5faab765cf0775ea70cd2aa38bd70432) a small script that I adapted a bit so the extracted files are numbered, since we need to associate the character with the position within the final text later on.

Now with all the revisions we can decode one by one. But doing it by hand is tedious and tiring work, so I searched for possible automations. The problem was, that all approaches I found got me mostly bad results as the files used verify different frequencies for the morse signal. Refining a decoder script was also out of the question, so I looked at the data again and found that many files contained exactly the same data. With all these duplicates the amount of files to decode was drastically reduces. I again chose to use the [`online tools`](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) to translate one of the files. Then compared which files contained the same data and renamed all files suffixed with the decoded content. For instance, file `0002.wav` would decode to `alfa`, I then renamed the file and ran a small script that renamed all matching files also to `alfa_{number}.wav`.

```python
import filecmp
import os
import sys

f1 = sys.argv[1]
value = f1.split("_")[1]
print(value)

for f2 in os.listdir("."):
    if f1 == f2: continue
    if filecmp.cmp(f1, f2, shallow=True):
        name = os.path.splitext(f2)[0] + "_" + value
        os.rename(f2, name)
        print(f"{f1} same as {f2}, rename to {name}")
```

After that I decoded the next file and repeated this process until all files had the correct prefix. All in all the alphabet used matched exactly with the `base32` alphabet. Now we only had to iterate over all the files and map the alphabet character to the index and writing this to a file.

```python
import os

foo = [0]*4000

for f2 in os.listdir("../foo/gather"):
    x = f2.split("_")
    print(x)
    num = int(x[1].split(".")[0])
    foo[num] = x[0]

num = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]

f = open("out.txt", "w")
s = ""
for i, x in enumerate(foo[::-1]):
    if not isinstance(x, str):
        print("skipping", i, x)
        continue
    y = str.upper(x[0])
    if x in num:
        y = str(num.index(x))
    s = s + y
f.write(s)
f.close()
```

The output file then contained the base32 encoded text, after decoding we ended up with a `gzip compressed` blob.

```bash
$ cat out.txt | base32 -d > output_decoded
$ file output_decoded
output_decoded: gzip compressed data, last modified: Sat Sep  9 19:44:29 2023, original size modulo 2^32 3918
$ mv output_decoded output_decoded.gz && gunzip output_decoded.gz
```

Finally, the resulting message of the *AI* contained also the flag.

BOOK IV. OF KNOWLEDGE.

CHAPTER I.

Of knowledge in general.

1 and 2. [1. Our knowledge conversant about our ideas. 2.
Knowledge is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of
two ideas. } Knowledge is employed still more generally, in such a
way that it is found also in ideas or terms, before we come to prop
ositions or truths. And it may be said that he who shall have seen
attentively more pictures of plants and of animals, more figures of
machines, more descriptions or representations of houses or of fort
resses, who shall have read more ingenious romances, heard more
curious narratives, he, I say, will have more knowledge than an
other, even if there should not be a word of truth in all which has
been portrayed or related to him ; for the practice which he has in
representing to himself mentally many express and actual concep
tions or ideas, renders him more fit to conceive what is proposed to
him ; and it is certain that he will be better instructed and more
capable than another, who has neither seen nor read nor heard any
thing, provided that in these stories and representations he does not
take for true that which is not true, and that these impressions do not
hinder him otherwise from distinguishing the real from the imagni-
ary, or the existing from the possible .... But taking knowledge
in a narrower meaning, that is, for knowledge of truth, as you do
here, sir, I say that it is very true that truth is always founded in
the agreement or disagreement of ideas, but it is not true generally
that our knowledge of truth is a perception of this agreement or
disagreement. For when we know truth only empirically, from
having experienced it, without knowing the connection of things
and the reason which there is in what we have experienced, we
have no perception of this agreement or disagreement, unless it be
meant that we feel it confusedly without being conscious of it.
But your examples, it seems, show that you always require a knowl
edge in which one is conscious of connection or of opposition, and
this is what cannot be conceded to you. 7. Fourthly, Of real existence^}
I believe that it may be said that
connection is nothing else than accordance or relation, taken
generally. And I have remarked on this point that every relation
 is either of comparison or of concurrence. That of comparison
 gives diversity and identity, either in all or in something ;
that which makes the same or the diverse, the like or unlike.
Concurrence contains what you call co-existence, that is, connection of
existence. But when it is said that a thing exists or that it has real
existence, this existence itself is the predicate ; that is, it has an
idea joined with the idea in question, and there is connection be
tween these two notions. One may conceive also the existence of
the object of an idea, as the concurrence of this object with me. So
I believe that it may be said that there is only comparison or concurrence
; but that comparison, which marks identity or diversity,
and the concurrence of the thing with me, are relations which deserve
to be distinguished among others. More exact and more profound
researches might perhaps be made ; but I content myself
here with making remarks.
