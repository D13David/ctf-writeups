## Solution
For this challenge a lua script is provide. After opening it's obvious the script is obfuscated in various ways. When executed a banner is displayed and the user is prompted for input. The input seems to be validated and a message `LOSE` is displayed. Probably entering the flag would be a `WIN`.

```
$ lua zermatt.lua
 _____             _     ___ _____ ____
|   __|___ ___ ___| |___|   |_   _|  __|
|  |  | . | . | . | | -_| -<  | | |  __|
|_____|___|___|_  |_|___|___| |_| |_|
              |___|       ZerMatt - misc
> asdasdasd
LOSE
```

To get a better overview we run a beautifier on the script to have at least sane formatting.

```bash
lua-format --column-limit=1000 zermatt.lua > zermatt1.lua
```

The script is still very much unreadable. There are a few obfuscation techniques that need to be reversed. For one strings are encoded like

```lua
local v8 = _G[v7("\79\15\131\30\40\13\20\203", "\59\96\237\107\69\111\113\185")];
    local v9 = _G[v7("\55\2\190\232\63\247", "\68\118\204\129\81\144\122")][v7("\12\180\100\225", "\110\205\16\132\107\85\33\139")];
    local v10 = _G[v7("\243\205\101\215\89\95", "\128\185\23\190\55\56\100")][v7("\240\94\174\46", "\147\54\207\92\126\115\131")];
```

The function to decode is already present `v7`, so we can just use this function to decode the strings. Also we rename the function to `concatString` and also clean up the code a bit.

```lua
local function concatString(part1, part2)
    local result = {};
    for i = 1, #part1 do table.insert(result, string.char(bit32.bxor(string.byte(string.sub(part1, i, i + 1)), string.byte(string.sub(part2, 1 + ((i - 1) % #part2), 1 + ((i - 1) % #part2) + 1))) % 256)); end
    return table.concat(result);
end
```

After decoding the strings we replace the variables `v8`, `v9`, `v10`, ... with the associated function names within the script. This already brings a tiny bit of readability. But there is still more to clean up.

One specific pattern is used over and over. The progam flow is broken down into small sections and executed like a state machine. This is easy, although quite annoying, to clean up.

```lua
local v291 = 0;
local v292;
local v293;
while true do
    if (v291 == 0) then
        v292 = 0;
        v293 = nil;
        v291 = 1;
    end
    if (v291 == 1) then
        while true do
            if (v292 == 0) then
                v293 = v193[(6419 - 5004) - (98 + 349 + 966)];
                v191[v293](v21(v191, v293 + (978 - (553 + 424)), v159));
                break
            end
        end
        break
    end
end
```

After removing the outer state blocks and then the inner state blocks the code is getting shorter.

```lua
v292 = 0;
v293 = nil;
while true do
    if (v292 == 0) then
        v293 = v193[(6419 - 5004) - (98 + 349 + 966)];
        v191[v293](v21(v191, v293 + (978 - (553 + 424)), v159));
        break
    end
end
```

```lua
v293 = v193[(6419 - 5004) - (98 + 349 + 966)];
v191[v293](v21(v191, v293 + (978 - (553 + 424)), v159));
```

After going through the `1870` or so lines the code was condensed to under `400` lines of code. Also the code blocks where now sorted in the right order so that the code was quite readable and nearly ready for inspection. One last thing remaing was the obfuscated numeric literals รก la `(6419 - 5004) - (98 + 349 + 966)`. This could be easily replaced with the resulting value.

```lua
v293 = v193[2];
v191[v293](v21(v191, v293 + 1), v159);
```

Next up, inspecting the code and trying to understand bits and pieces. Renaming here and there a function or variable, and trying to get as much info as possible out of the code. A couple of small functions are present for reading bytes, shorts, longs, strings, ... from a byte stream as as a few other functionality. After giving the functions readable names more and more bits of the code started to make sense. The code flow is something like this.

Starting with `main`, the main function is called with a long string and the global table. The string is compressed with a basic RLE compression. In `main` the string is decompressed as a first step.

```lua
-- basic RLE decompression of payload 
local repeatCount = nil;
payloadBuffer = string.gsub(string.sub(payloadBuffer, 5), "..", function(v86)
    -- if pair ends with 'O' first part is the repeat length
    if (string.byte(v86, 2) == 79) then
        repeatCount = tonumber(string.sub(v86, 1, 1));
        return "";
    else
        local currentByte = string.char(tonumber(v86, 16));
        if repeatCount then
            local currentByteRepeated = string.rep(currentByte, repeatCount);
            repeatCount = nil;
            return currentByteRepeated;
        else
            return currentByte;
        end
    end
end);
```

A decompressed dump of the payload can be found  [`here`](output.bin). After this the buffer is further processed and then passed to another function. After staring at both functions for a while it turned out that the second function is basically a VM executing some bytecode, which is used in the first function. Therefore the functions are named `loadImage` and `run`.

```lua
function loadImage()
    local codeSegment = {};
    local subPrograms = {};
    local v58 = {};
    local result = {codeSegment, subPrograms, nil, v58};
    
    local dataTableSize = readInt();
    local dataTable = {};
    for i = 1, dataTableSize do
        local valueType = readByte();
        local value = nil;
        if (valueType == 1) then
            value = readByte() ~= 0;
        elseif (valueType == 2) then
            value = readFloat();
        elseif (valueType == 3) then
            value = readByteArray();
        end
        dataTable[i] = value;
    end

    result[3] = readByte();
    for i = 1, readInt() do
        local bitPackedValue = readByte();
        if (valueForBitRange(bitPackedValue, 1, 1) == 0) then
            local bits2_3 = valueForBitRange(bitPackedValue, 2, 3);
            local bits4_6 = valueForBitRange(bitPackedValue, 4, 6);
            local opcode = {readShort(), readShort(), nil, nil}; 
            if (bits2_3 == 0) then
                opcode[3] = readShort();
                opcode[4] = readShort();
            elseif (bits2_3 == 1) then
                opcode[3] = readInt();
            elseif (bits2_3 == 2) then
                opcode[3] = readInt() - 65536;
            elseif (bits2_3 == 3) then
                opcode[3] = readInt() - 65536;
                opcode[4] = readShort();
            end
            if (valueForBitRange(bits4_6, 1, 1) == 1) then opcode[2] = dataTable[opcode[2]]; end
            if (valueForBitRange(bits4_6, 2, 2) == 1) then opcode[3] = dataTable[opcode[3]]; end
            if (valueForBitRange(bits4_6, 3, 3) == 1) then opcode[4] = dataTable[opcode[4]]; end
            codeSegment[i] = opcode;
            --printOpcode(i, opcode);
        end
    end
    
    for i = 1, readInt() do subPrograms[i - 1] = loadImage(); end
    for i = 1, readInt() do v58[i] = readInt(); end
    return result;
end

function run(image, stack, global)
-- ...
end

-- snip main

return run(loadImage(), {}, v29)(...);
```

The first thing that is loaded is a list of constants. The first 4 bytes specify the size of the table and then there is one entry per constant containing a type (1 byte) and depending of the type the type value. Three types could be found `byte`, `float` and `string`. The dump of the constant list can be seen here:

```
Constant Table =======================================
01: (s): string
02: (s): char
03: (s): byte
04: (s): sub
05: (s): bit32
06: (s): bit
07: (s): bxor
08: (s): table
09: (s): concat
10: (s): insert
11: (s): io
12: (s): write
13: (s):  _____             _     ___ _____ ____ 0a
14: (s): |   __|___ ___ ___| |___|   |_   _|  __|0a
15: (s): |  |  | . | . | . | | -_| -<  | | |  __|0a
16: (s): |_____|___|___|_  |_|___|___| |_| |_|   0a
17: (s):               |___|       ZerMatt - misc 0a
18: (s): @91
19: (s): ~b1a3bbE86dba7
20: (s): s
21: (s): read
22: (s): df17eb1e4e81cc1/c4ef7f2#d1c34cc9faf2,d915c4c3!d4>c0ff,c9/fafe"de/faef"c3.c7f3;f2/d6ff"dd/d8
23: (s): 9cCadJa5
24: (s): print
25: (s): q1d99
26: (s): &Td7)vdcF
27: (s): d27f%07
28: (s): 9e0vBr
```

Afterwards the opcodes are parsed. The number of opcodes is specified by an 4 bytes integer and then every opcode has a `code` so the interpreter knows how to handle the opcode and three parameters that can be used as command input (like target register index, memory address, constant, ...). A packed value specify which parameters are initialized and how they are stored. Bit 1-2 are specifying the type of the parameters. For instance, `type 0` reads two shorts for parameters 2 and 3, while `type 1` reads a long for parameter 2 only.

Bits 3-5 then specify if a parameter is resolved with the constant table, for instance are an index to a function name or any other text.

In the last step potential other programs are loaded which have the same format, starting with a constant table etc...

The `run` function then basically executes the opcode list. Some more cleanup was needed since the functionality was too nested. One thing to point out is, that run does not immediately run the code but returns a function pointer that can be stored within memory and executed by following commands. 

```lua
_G['A'], _G['B'] = createTableAndCount(pcall(v162));
if not _G['A'][1] then
    local v183 = image[4][currentInstruction] or "?";
    error("Script error at [" .. v183 .. "]:" .. _G['A'][2]);
else
    return table.unpack(_G['A'], 2, _G['B']);
end
```

The function calls another local function `v162` which is the VM. `v162` first initializes the memory with parameters passed to the program and then has a big loop where command execution happens.

```lua
for i = 0, countOfArguments do
    if (i >= v69) then
        v189[i - v69] = v160[i + 1];
    else
        mem[i] = v160[i + 1];
    end
end
while true do
    local op = codeSegment[currentInstruction];
    local opcodeType = op[OP_TYPE];
    if (opcodeType == 0) then
        return table.unpack(mem, op[OP_PARAM1], loadedTableSize);
    elseif (opcodeType == 1) then
        mem[op[OP_PARAM1]] = mem[op[OP_PARAM2]] - op[OP_PARAM3];
    elseif (opcodeType == 2) then
        mem[op[OP_PARAM1]] = mem[op[OP_PARAM2]] % op[OP_PARAM3];
    elseif (opcodeType == 3) then
        currentInstruction = op[OP_PARAM2];
    elseif (opcodeType == 4) then
        if (mem[op[OP_PARAM1]] == mem[op[OP_PARAM3]]) then
            currentInstruction = currentInstruction + 1;
        else
            currentInstruction = op[OP_PARAM2];
        end
    else 
    -- snip
end
```

So, running the script will decode the program image and execute the image. Doing so and dumping `_G['A']` will give us the flag, since the program is decoding the flag and storing it in memory. But this would be cheating, right?

To get a better understanding on what the program is doing the assembly of a run can be dumped with some debugging information. This is quite easy, just a big function dumping info for every opcode.

```lua
function printOpcode(addr, op)
    io.write(string.format("\n%04x: ", addr));
    local opcodeType = op[OP_TYPE];
    if (opcodeType == 0) then
        io.write("RET "); io.write(string.format("\t%d #tblcnt", op[OP_PARAM1]))
    elseif (opcodeType == 1) then
        io.write("SUB "); io.write(string.format("\t[%d], [%d] %d", op[OP_PARAM1], op[OP_PARAM2], op[OP_PARAM3]));
    elseif (opcodeType == 2) then
        io.write("MOD "); io.write(string.format("\t[%d], [%d] %d", op[OP_PARAM1], op[OP_PARAM2], op[OP_PARAM3]));
    elseif (opcodeType == 3) then
        io.write("JMP "); io.write(string.format("\t%04x", op[OP_PARAM2]));
    --- snip
end
```

Doing this gives a full trace of the program execution. A small part is shown here in this article, the full trace can be found [`here`](zermatt_trace.txt).

First some functions are loaded into memory and the only subroutine is initialized with the same set of functionality.
```
0001: OBJ       [0], G['string']
0002: LOAD      [0], char               (table): ???
0003: OBJ       [1], G['string']
0004: LOAD      [1], byte               (table): ???
0005: OBJ       [2], G['string']
0006: LOAD      [2], sub                (table): ???
0007: OBJ       [3], G['bit32']
0008: JE        000a, [3]               (table): ???
000b: LOAD      [4], bxor               (table): ???
000c: OBJ       [5], G['table']
000d: LOAD      [5], concat             (table): ???
000e: OBJ       [6], G['table']
000f: LOAD      [6], insert             (table): ???
0010: LOAD      [7], 0                           0 mem[6] (f): table.insert 1 mem[0] (f): string.char 2 mem[4] (f): bit32.bxor 3 mem[1] (f): string.byte 4 mem[2] (f): string.sub 5 mem[5] (f): table.concat
```

Then the banner is printed.

```

This part is interesting as it involves calling the subroutine (in register `7`) with two byte array `4091` and `7eb1a3bb4586dba7`. The values are loaded to the registers right after the function and `LDTBL1` calls the function and passes the argument table to the function.
```
002d: MOV       [9], [7]                (f): unknown
002e: MOV       [10], (s): 4091
002f: MOV       [11], (s): 7eb1a3bb4586dba7
0030: LDTBL1    [9], 10 11              (s): 4091 (s): 7eb1a3bb4586dba7
```

This is the function that is called. It basically is used to decrypt the string passed as parameter. The algorithm is a simple `xor` with a given key.
```
0001: TABLE     [2]                                                                 -- create new table

So we know how the subroutine is decrypting messages. After entering a random string the program flow goes on. We can see that another encrypted message is loaded with yet another decryption key. But the same subroutine is used for decryption, so we can implement our own encryption method with `python`.

```python
flag = bytearray.fromhex("df17eb31e4e81cc12fc4ef37f223d1c334cc39faf22cd915c4c321d43ec0ff2cc92ffafe22de2ffaef22c32ec7f33bf22fd6ff22dd2fd8")
key = bytearray.fromhex("9c43ad4aa5")

for i,c in enumerate(flag):
    x.append(chr(c^key[i%len(key)]))
```

It's as easy as this, after running the script we get our flag. And for good measure, lets enter the correct flag:

```
$ lua zermatt.lua
 _____             _     ___ _____ ____
|   __|___ ___ ___| |___|   |_   _|  __|
|  |  | . | . | . | | -_| -<  | | |  __|
|_____|___|___|_  |_|___|___| |_| |_|
              |___|       ZerMatt - misc
> CTF{At_least_it_was_not_a_bytecode_base_sandbox_escape}
WIN
```

The deobfuscated state of the script with debug code can be found [`here`](zermatt1.lua).
