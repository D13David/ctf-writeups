## My First Hash

> Here's your flag: `8f163b472e2164f66a5cd751098783f9` Psyc! Its encrypted. You think I'd give it to you that easily? Definitely don't look at my code tho -><- (when you find the flag, put it in `bctf{}` format)

## Solution
This challenge gives us a hash. First thing is to check if this is a known hash (e.g. using [`crackstation`](https://crackstation.net/)), giving us `orchestra`.

Flag `bctf{orchestra}`
