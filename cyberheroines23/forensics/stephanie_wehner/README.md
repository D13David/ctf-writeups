## Solution
For this challenge a `memory dump` is given. To analyze this we can use [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility). First thing is to find more informations about the dump.

```bash
$ vol.py -f dump.vmem imageinfo
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
INFO    : volatility.debug    : Determining profile based on KDBG search...
          Suggested Profile(s) : Win8SP0x64, Win81U1x64, Win2012R2x64_18340, Win2012R2x64, Win2012x64, Win8SP1x64_18340, Win8SP1x64
                     AS Layer1 : SkipDuplicatesAMD64PagedMemory (Kernel AS)
                     AS Layer2 : FileAddressSpace (/home/ctf/dump.vmem)
                      PAE type : No PAE
                           DTB : 0x1a7000L
                          KDBG : 0xf8037feaba30L
          Number of Processors : 1
     Image Type (Service Pack) : 0
                KPCR for CPU 0 : 0xfffff8037ff06000L
             KUSER_SHARED_DATA : 0xfffff78000000000L
           Image date and time : 2023-08-03 21:21:54 UTC+0000
     Image local date and time : 2023-08-03 17:21:54 -0400
```

Now we know the profile `Win8SP0x64` we can start some analysis. The challenge description mentioned the flag was in `notepad` so we can try to dump the process memory of `notepad`. For this we need the `pid`.

```bash
$ vol.py -f dump.vmem --profile=Win8SP0x64 pslist | grep notepad
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
0xffffe000021c3900 notepad.exe            2452   1180      2        0      1      0 2023-08-03 21:20:36 UTC+0000
```

Next we can dump the process memory.

```bash
$ vol.py -f dump.vmem --profile=Win8SP0x64 memdump --dump-dir=./ -p 2452
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
************************************************************************
Writing notepad.exe [  2452] to 2452.dmp
```

Now we can check what strings are within the process dump. Since windows is using `utf-16` strings we have to use `-e l` when calling `strings`. Amongst a whole lot of strings we find this interesting piece.

```bash
Welcome to CyberHeroines CTF !
No, No, chctf{this_is_not_the_flag} - not a leet format
Try harder !!!

Only a fake flag was in notepad but there is a github user we can check out. The user has one repository called `Secret`.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FITCF/Secret

$ cat Secret/A_Cyber_Heroine.txt
Well, there's nothing here!
```

Nothing here.. But maybe in the history?
