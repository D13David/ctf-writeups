## Solution
For this challenge we get two files. A bitmap and what appears to be the `AES` encrypted version of the bitmap.

![](flag.bmp)

Since it's known that AES is inherently bad with image data we can just try to visualize the encoded image. For this I copied the [bitmap header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) with a hexeditor from `flag.bmp` over to `flag.enc` so the image can be opened as is and...

Flag `chctf{m0th3r_0f_crypt0}`
