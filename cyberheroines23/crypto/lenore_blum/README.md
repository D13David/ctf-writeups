## Solution
When we connect to the service we have the option to play a little guessing game. We get a `seed` and then have to guess a random number. To see how things work we can open the attached binary with `Gidra`.

```bash
$ nc 0.cloud.chals.io 28827
Lets play a little game.
I give you a seed, and you guess my random number.
Would you like to play? Y/N >>> y
Here is my seed: 86275273
Can you guess my random number? >>> 1337
Incorrect. My random number was 1059388257381471813
```

```c
  printf(
        "Lets play a little game.\nI give you a seed, and you guess my random number.\nWould you lik e to play? Y/N >>> "
        );
  local_31 = 'n';
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00402095,&local_31);
  if (local_31 == 'y') {
    while( true ) {
      tVar2 = time((time_t *)0x0);
      srand((uint)tVar2);
      iVar1 = rand();
      local_10 = (long)(iVar1 % 65000);
      local_18 = find_prime_congruent_to_3_mod_4(local_10);
      local_20 = find_prime_congruent_to_3_mod_4(local_18 + 1);
      local_28 = local_10 * 0x539;
      printf("Here is my seed: %lld\nCan you guess my random number? >>> ",local_28);
      local_40 = 0;
      __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_004020d3,&local_40);
      local_30 = bbs(local_18,local_20,local_28);
      if (local_30 == local_40) break;
      printf("Incorrect. My random number was %lld\n",local_30);
    }
    puts("Great job! Here\'s your prize:");
    print_file("flag.txt");
```

As we can see the application uses `srand(time(NULL))` to initialize the `RNG`. Then it takes a 32 bit random number mod 65000 (seed) and calculates two prime numbers congruent to 3 mod 4. The seed we get is multiplied with `1337`. Then the user input is requested and afterwards everything goes into a function called `bbs`.

Since we have have the input for `find_prime_congruent_to_3_mod_4` lets see what this function does.

```c
long find_prime_congruent_to_3_mod_4(long param_1)
{
  char cVar1;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = param_1;
  while( true ) {
    cVar1 = is_prime(local_10);
    if ((cVar1 != '\0') && (((uint)local_10 & 3) == 3)) break;
    local_10 = local_10 + 1;
  }
  return local_10;
}

ulong bbs(long param_1,long param_2,long param_3)
{
  int local_1c;
  ulong local_18;
  ulong local_10;
  
  local_10 = (ulong)(param_3 * param_3) % (ulong)(param_1 * param_2);
  local_18 = 0;
  for (local_1c = 0; local_1c < 0x3f; local_1c = local_1c + 1) {
    local_10 = (local_10 * local_10) % (ulong)(param_1 * param_2);
    local_18 = local_18 | (ulong)((uint)local_10 & 1) << ((byte)local_1c & 0x3f);
  }
  return local_18;
}
```

This is easy enough and does exactly what the function name said. Since we have the *seed* we can calculate the exact two numbers locally as well putting them through `bbs` generating the same number as the service does.

```python
import sympy

def find(num):
    while True:
        if sympy.isprime(num) and (num & 3) == 3:
            break
        num = num + 1
    return num

seed = 14864766
prime1 = find(seed//1337)
prime2 = find(prime1+1)

local_10 = (seed * seed) % (prime1 * prime2)
local_18 = 0
for i in range(0, 0x3f):
    local_10 = (local_10*local_10) % (prime1 * prime2)
    local_18 = local_18 | (local_10 & 1) << (i & 0x3f)

print(local_18)
```

Lets play another round, this time we guess correct and get the flag.

```bash
$ nc 0.cloud.chals.io 28827
Lets play a little game.
I give you a seed, and you guess my random number.
Would you like to play? Y/N >>> y
Here is my seed: 14864766
Can you guess my random number? >>> 198617183237813426
Great job! Here's your prize:
chctf{tH3_f1rsT_Blum}
```

Flag `chctf{tH3_f1rsT_Blum}`
