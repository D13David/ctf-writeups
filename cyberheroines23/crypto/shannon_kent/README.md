## Shannon Kent

> [Shannon Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_M._Kent): A specialist in cryptologic warfare and fluent in seven languages, Senior Chief Shannon Kent served multiple tours in Iraq, participating in numerous special operations that contributed to the capture of hundreds of enemy insurgents. She paved the way for greater inclusion of women in Special Operations Forces and was one of the first women to pass the Naval Special Warfare Direct Support Course. Kent was killed in action in Syria on Jan. 16, 2019, and posthumously promoted to senior chief petty officer. - [Navy.mil Reference](https://www.navy.mil/Women-In-the-Navy/Past/Display-Past-Woman-Bio/Article/2959760/senior-chief-shannon-kent/)

## Solution
For this challenge we get a `Dockerfile` and a python script with only some imports. The files are ment for local exploit development and the imports really are a hint to find the solution.

When we connect to the service we get some information:
```bash
$ nc 0.cloud.chals.io 27572

```

The reciepe how the flag was *secured* is printed here also a starting time. First I thought we had to retreive the correct seed to generate the same random values for `xor`. But this was not the case, the length of the random byte keys are also a hint. In both cases we know the exact amount of information the reconstruct the keys. 

For the first round we know the flag starts with the six chars `chctf{`. And for the second round we have all the information the build the 10 byte [gzip header](https://docs.fileformat.com/compression/gz/).

Let's get cracking, the first round is easy: convert the hex-string to bytes and unzip the one file from this buffer:

```python
#<<< ZIPping result (with zipfile.ZipFile compression=ZIP_DEFLATED)
zip_buffer = bytes.fromhex(flag)
with ZipFile(BytesIO(zip_buffer), 'r') as file:
    print(file.namelist())
    buffer1 = file.read("data.bin")
```

For the second part we know it's a gzipped buffer. So it must start with a gzip header which is 10 bytes long and exactly the length of our xor key (perfect isn't it)?

```
Offset  Size    Value       Description
0       2       0x1f 0x8b   Magic number
2       1                   Compression method
3       1                   Flags
4       4                   32 bit timestamp
8       1                   Compression flags
9       1                   Operating system ID
```

From this we can retrieve the xor key and then retrieve the gzipped buffer.

```python
#<<< XORing result with random 10 byte key
t = datetime(2023, 9, 10, 9, 57, 51)
ts = pack("<I", int(t.timestamp()))
gzip_header = b'\x1f\x8b\x08\x00' + ts + b'\x02\xff'
key = xor(buffer1[0:10], gzip_header)
buffer2 = xor(buffer1, key)
```

Next we just decompress the buffer.

```python
#<<< GZIPing result (with gzip.compress with max compression)
buffer3 = decompress(buffer2)
```

For the last part we need to retrieve the 6 bytes key. Since we know that the flag starts with `chctf{` we can proceed exactly how we did before. After getting the key we xor the full buffe with this key and get the flag.

```python
#<<< XORing flag with random 6 byte key
key = xor(buffer3[0:6], b"chctf{")
flag = xor(buffer3, key)
```

Flag `chctf{th3_l3g3nd_oF_SHann0n_K3nt}`
