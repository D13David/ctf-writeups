# LACTF 2023

## valentines-day

> Happy Valentine's Day! I'm unfortunately spending my Valentine's Day working on my CS131 homework. I'm getting bored so I wrote something for my professor. To keep it secret, I encrypted it with a Vigenere cipher with a really long key (161 characters long!)

## Solution
The desription gives pretty much anything away. The given text is encrypted via [`Vigenère cipher`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) using a 161 character long key. There are [`tools`](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver) that can easily reconstruct such a key in a short amount of time but we have the first sentence given as plain text, so we can just try to reconstruct the key ourself.

```python
ct = open("ct.txt", "rb").read()
t  = open("intro.txt", "rb").read()

key = []
for i in range(len(t)):
    if (t[i] >= ord('a') and t[i] <= ord('z')) or (t[i] >= ord('A') and t[i] <= ord('Z')):
        key.append((ct[i]-t[i] + 26) % 26)

key.extend([0]*(161-len(key)))

for c in key: print(chr(c+ord('a')), end="")
```

We just pad the text to the correct length, since the given plain-text is not enough to reconstruct the full key. Since the key is repeated over and over again we will not decrypt the full text but have passages that doesn't decrypt. Lets see if thats enough already. Running the script gives us the following key: `nevergonnagiveyouupnevergonnaletyoudownnevergonnarunaroundanddesertyounevergonnamakeyoucrynevergonnasaygooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`.

```python
index = 0
for c in ct:
    offset = 0
    if (c >= ord('a') and c <= ord('z')):
        offset = ord('a')
    elif (c >= ord('A') and c <= ord('Z')):
        offset = ord('A')
    else:
        print(chr(c), end="")
        continue

    c = ((((c - offset) - key[index%len(key)]) + 26) % 26) + offset
    index += 1
    print(chr(c), end="")
```

Using this key we can decrypt enough to get the flag:

```bash
$ python decrypt.py
On this Valentine's day, I wanted to show my love for professor Paul Eggert. This challenge is dedicated to him. Enjoy the challenge!
