## Solution
For this challenge we get a zip archive containing a `dockersetup` for a simple maze game. I didn't run the game at all and just statically reversed it. With the deployment we find the executable. After short inspection with `Ghidra` it became clear that the executable in fact is a `pyinstaller` binary. There are some [`pyinstaller extractor scripts`](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) which can be used to get the python resources.

After extraction one file especially seems interesting `main.pyc`. Since it is compiled python bytecode we can try to decompile it with `pycdc`, but sadly the decompiler stumbled across various unsupported opcodes. So the is to just disassemble the file and try to reverse it from there.

The first two functions are very short

```python
# end
0       RESUME                        0
2       LOAD_GLOBAL                   1: NULL + print
14      LOAD_CONST                    1: 'Nice Job, You reached the end!'
16      PRECALL                       1
20      CALL                          1
30      POP_TOP                       
32      LOAD_CONST                    0: None
34      RETURN_VALUE                  

# checkfinish
0       RESUME                        0
2       LOAD_GLOBAL                   0: j
14      LOAD_CONST                    1: 125
16      COMPARE_OP                    2 (==)
22      POP_JUMP_FORWARD_IF_FALSE     13 (to 50)
24      LOAD_GLOBAL                   2: i
36      LOAD_CONST                    2: 1
38      COMPARE_OP                    2 (==)
44      POP_JUMP_FORWARD_IF_FALSE     4 (to 54)
46      LOAD_CONST                    3: True
48      RETURN_VALUE                  
50      LOAD_CONST                    0: None
52      RETURN_VALUE                  
54      LOAD_CONST                    0: None
56      RETURN_VALUE                  
```

The functions can be easily back translated to python and look something like this. The first function just prints a message, the second function returns true if variables `i` and `j` have a specific value. Both variables are global and, as it later turns out, are used to represent the players position.

```python
def end():
    print("Nice Job, You reached the end!")

def checkfinish():
    if j == 125 and i == 1:
        return True
```

Next comes the functions `print_board` and `on_press` which we skip for now, since we first want to make sense of the datastructure which is used to represent the maze. The loading code is in global scope and looks like this:

```python
0       RESUME                        0
2       LOAD_CONST                    0: 0
4       LOAD_CONST                    1: ('keyboard',)

8       IMPORT_FROM                   1: keyboard
10      STORE_NAME                    1: keyboard
12      POP_TOP                       
14      LOAD_CONST                    0: 0
16      LOAD_CONST                    2: None
18      IMPORT_NAME                   2: os
20      STORE_NAME                    2: os

284     JUMP_BACKWARD                 109
```

Putthing the annotations together we get the following. The variables `m_string` and `chars` are initialized with some huge strings, also `size` is set to 201. Then an array `m` is created and filled with zero or one depending on a value computation with values from `m_string`. The array `m` describes then the full maze: rows and columns build a 2d grid and at each cell either 1 or 0 specifies if there is a wall or not.

```python
m_string = "..."
chars = "..."
size = 201

m = []

for i in range(0, size**2)
    if i % size == 0:
        m.append([])
    row = m[-1]
    cell = ord(m_string[i//8]) & (1 << (((i % 8) - 7)))
    if cell == 0:
        row.append(0)
    else:
        row.append(1)
```

After this the player position is set to `59, 199` and then reset to `127, 1`. The board is drawn and the keyboard listener is set to function `on_press`. Inbetween some functions are loaded and created. But since this doesn't really matters we skip this here.

```python
position = (59, 199)
j = position[0]
i = position[1]

j = 127
i = 1 

print_board()
keyboard.Listener(on_press)
listener.join()
```

Now we know how the data is loaded we can check out what happens when the board is drawn. First the screen is cleared. Then a nested loop is done over all the region surrounding the current player position, so that the player position is centered to this region. The player sprite is drawn at `0, 0` and a flag symbol is drawn if the visible region contains cell `1, 125`. This basically draws only a small visible region around where the player is located.

```python
# clear screen
0       RESUME                        0

Next the map values for the current cell are loaded and either a wall sprite is printed or, in empty space, some hex-values coming from `chars`.

This whole part basically translates to

```python
def print_board():
    for y in range(-2, 3):
        for x in range(-2, 3):
            if x == 0 and y == 0: print("ðŸ˜€", end="")
            
            if y+j == 125 and x+i == 1: print("ðŸš©", end="")
                
            cell = m[(j+y)%len(m)][(i+x) % len(m[0])]
            if cell == 1:
                print("â–ˆâ–ˆ", end = "")
            else:
                value = chars[((j+y)%len(m))*size + ((i+x)%len(m[0]))]
                print(value*2, end = "")
```

But we want to see the whole maze, so we adapt this and draw the whole world in one go. As a result we get this beatiful result.

And zoomed in a bit, we can see the empty space is filled with numbers.

For completeness here the `on_press` handler that handles player movement and wall collision. For each move it checks if the player hit the flag field and if so the screen is cleared and the message `Nice Job, You reached the end!` is printed.

```python
def on_press(key):
    if key == Key.up:
        j -= abs(m[j-1][i] - 1)
        check = checkfinish()
    elif key == Key.down:
        j += abs(m[j+1][i] - 1)
        check = checkfinish()
    elif key == Key.left:
        i -= abs(m[j][i-1] - 1)
        check = checkfinish()
    elif key == Key.right:
        i += abs(m[j][i+1] - 1)
        check = checkfinish()
    elif key == Key.space:
        listener.stop()
    
    print_board()
    
    if check:
        listener.stop()
        if os.name == 'nt':
            system('clear')
        else:
            system('cls')
        end()
```

Now we know how the game works, we need to find the flag. But where *is* the flag? The hint in the description tells us `Put the flag inside `INTIGRITI{}` and the format of the flag is hex.`, and we have a lot of hex numbers in the maze. But which number are the correct ones?

I did a lot of trial and error, taking the numbers starting at the flag field for instance. But nothing really worked. Another weird thing was, the player spawn position was pretty much right next to the flag field? But what if, the player spawn position override was not really the correct position, but the position which was set *before*? In this case the player would have to go some way until reaching the flag.

Then I had the idea, maybe the player would need to find the shortest way to the flag and collect numbers on his way? This can be done with a `BFS` path scanning.

```python
def dfs(vis, x, y, stack):
    if y*size+x > len(chars) or vis[y*size+x] == True:
        return

    stack.append((x,y))
    if checkfinish(x,y):
        for i in range(len(stack)-1):
            print(chars[stack[i][1]*size+stack[i][0]], end = "")
        print("")
        #print(stack[-1])i
        return

    vis[y*size+x] = True

    if m[y-1][x] == 0: dfs(vis, x, y-1, stack)
    if m[y+1][x] == 0: dfs(vis, x, y+1, stack)
    if m[y][x-1] == 0: dfs(vis, x-1, y, stack)
    if m[y][x+1] == 0: dfs(vis, x+1, y, stack)

    del stack[-1]

stack = []
vis = [0 for i in range(len(m)*len(m[0]))]
dfs(vis, 199, 59, stack)
```

This didn't give the correct flag either, so I tried multiple variations (collecting the duplicated numbers vs only single numbers) etc. In the end, it turned out, that the flag path just didn't contain the *start* and *end* position. Removing the values gave the flag.
