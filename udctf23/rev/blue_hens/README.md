> Just wanted to make an NES game with a level loader in 6502. Works like this: Your job is to get the electrons to flow from the correct source to the correct sink (circle to circle, triangle to triangle, etc). You can highlight one circuit square at a time and swap it from it's original state to a different state. You only get N moves per level (top right corner), hit start when you think the puzzle is solved and the electrons will flow. This is a rev problem not misc... We built this in an NES game jam.
