## Solution
After searching around in Chicago West loop a bit (and checking the hint `what does joy translate to?`), one of the restaurants fits the description, the [`Gioia Chicago`](https://goo.gl/maps/P8ty7LoUd2njDQwu6). After searching the reviews and images for some time without luck I tried to guess which `well knwon socual network` could be meant and luckily found a result [`here`](https://twitter.com/JonahExplorer). And indeed there is one tweet with the flag.
