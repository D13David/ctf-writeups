## Solution
For this I searched `New York subway shovel` with google and got some good results. `The Museum of the City of New York` has a [`
Ceremonial shovel used in making the first excavation for the subway on March 24, 1900`](https://collections.mcny.org/asset-management/2F3XC583Z9IL) that fits the description.
